# EXIF Reader
This code reads the EXIF data from an image file and prints out the various metadata fields for the user to see. The metadata fields include information such as the date the photo was taken, the camera model used, and the exposure settings. The code uses the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module to read the image and extract the EXIF data, and the PIL.ExifTags module to convert the EXIF data's tag IDs into human-readable names. The code iterates over all the EXIF data fields and decodes the data into a readable format before printing it out.
